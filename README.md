# git-commit-peek

## Overview

**Git Commit Peek** is a Visual Studio Code extension that shows the files changed in the last commit of your current Git repository. It provides a fast and simple way to quickly view the most recent changes directly within the VS Code Source Control view.

## How It Works

After installing the extension, a new view called **Last Commit Files** appears in the Source Control (SCM) sidebar. You can now choose between a **List View** and a **Tree View** to display the files changed in the latest commit:

- **List View**: Displays all changed files in a flat list for quick access.
- **Tree View**: Shows files organized by folder structure, making it easy to navigate large commits.

You can switch between these views using the provided option in the extension's UI. Selecting a file allows you to peek at its changes or open it for review.

No configuration is required. The extension works out-of-the-box for any folder opened in VS Code that is a Git repository.

## Features

- View files changed in the last commit using either a tree or list view
